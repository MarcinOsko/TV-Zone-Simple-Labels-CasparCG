Simple Labels
**********************************

Simple Labels is an application that controls the CasparCG graphics engine. It allows to control graphic elements with dynamically changing text content provided from Simple Labels. These can include lower thirds, title bars, tickers, scoreboards, tables, and virtually any other graphical element for broadcasting.

In the free version of Simple Labels, it can control one HTML5 template at a time, which includes two text fields that can be independently filled with data gathered from the application. The data entered into the application can be saved to and loaded from a file, and it can be imported and exported to the CasparCG server.

Simple Labels is resilient to threats such as local network failure (loss of server connection) or accidental shutdown of the CasparCG server or Simple Labels application itself. The application has been designed in such a way that it does not jeopardize production in the studio under any of these circumstances. The Simple Labels system can be restored to operation at any time without the risk of unforeseen complications in the output from the CasparCG engine.

If You Find Simple Labels Appealing And Would Like To Integrate The Functionality Of Our Application And The Formats For Reading Data Files With Your Studio Systems, Please Contact Us. We Can Create A Customized Version Of Our Application Specifically For You.

Installation and Configuration
**********************************

Installation and setup instructions are here:
https://tvsimpleapps.com/installation-and-configuration/

If you haven’t installed the CasparCG engine yet, you can download the latest version. Installation instructions can be found in many online resources. I suggest looking in the following places:

GitHub  –  https://github.com/CasparCG/server
CasparCG forum – https://casparcgforum.org/
CacparCG  – http://casparcg.com

The Simple Labels computer and the CasparCG computer should be in the same IP address class and the same LAN network. Both machines should have communication open on TCP/UDP ports 5250 and 5263. Simple Labels in Free Version uses channel 1 and layer 20 on CasparCG.

Simple Labels and CasparCG can, of course, be running on one computer, but this will be possible only when we release our application on the PC platform. It will be soon :)
